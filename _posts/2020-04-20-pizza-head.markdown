![Pizza Head Sketch with Deleter Screentones](/assets/img/pizza-head.jpg)


I only really doodled today.  I've been having a lot of issues the past few years of finding the perfect sketchbook.  I'll go over it a little more in a post just about sketchbooks (I need to do a [LEUCHTTURM1917 Plain Journal](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/notebook-medium-a5-hardcover-251-numbered-pages-5-3-4-x-8-1-4-in.html "LEUCHTTURM1917") overlook and probably a full [Moleskine Large Sketchbook](https://us.moleskine.com/sketchbook-black/p0437 "Moleskine")), but the gist is that I am very indecisive and flip back and forth a lot looking for the perfect one at the moment.  It's a terrible habbit.

This fella turned out ok.  He was on a page full of floating heads.  I put some deleter screentone on him because why the fuck not you know?
