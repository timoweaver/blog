![1800 painting study master portrait profile woman ink and screentone sketch](/assets/img/painting-study-may-5th.jpg){: .half-width}

Playing with different sized screentones here, as well as throwing a "core shadow" in there to help the transition between white and tone on the skin.  Wally Wood did that a lot, I've been trying to workout how to do it in my own work.

The face is pretty soft, and trying to render the hair with the braids was fun (that's a challenge I would normally not take, hah).

I've been looking into how I can use things like this to influence my work, or even as reference to make new, finished things.  Lawd, new finished pieces!  I can barely imagine.

Side note, this is the closest I've felt to a LiveJournal feel in years.  I've enjoyed this new website update where I've had to "post" everything (also, maybe might help with some [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) too, better than my last site with all the images just on one page, hah).
