![Frankenstien Monster boris karloff Head Sketch with Deleter Screentones](/assets/img/frankenstein-monster-head.jpg){: .half-width}


This sketch of Frank turned out really cool too, so I need to post it as well.  Also has Deleter Screentones applied for the halftone effect. For sketches I use the little bits and bobs that I've already cut out for other illustrations, it's about the only way I can allow myself to use them for just a sketch.
