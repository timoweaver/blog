![Floating Nude Illustration ink brush screentone](/assets/img/floating-nude.jpg)

First thing I used screentones on this year.  I ended up transfering this from a sketch to bristol board with a lightbox.  I used to hate doing that, still do a bit but I'm getting better.  The original sketch always has way more life in it still, but this has some of it.  Dimensions are 9"x12", used a Pentel Pigment Ink brushpen, Strathmore 300 Smooth/Plate Bristol, Deleter Screentone Sheet SE-12 (30L, 20%)and did the pencils with a Natraj 621 Ruby pencil.  I got 50 of them bad boys on the way.
