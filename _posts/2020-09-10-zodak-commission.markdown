This was pretty fun, a full 11”x17” commission of Zodak (or Zodac, apparently) from He-Man and the Masters of the Universe for [L Jamal Walton](https://ljamal.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} with a request for screentone specifically! It let me cut loose and not be quite as reserved as i am in my personal work with it (it is a finite resource!).

Want a commission of your own? [Shoot me an email](mailto:timoweaver@gmail.com){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}! and we'll work out the details.
