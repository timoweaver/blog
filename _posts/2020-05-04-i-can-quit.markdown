Another little photo study in my sketchbook that I added screentones to for no reason. Trying to draw some different head shapes and facial features than I have been in my sketchbook (back to the Moleskine for this one too, btw).

This has been the longest I've been smoke free since before I started (basically since last November, minus a dalliance or two).  It's still not really out of my head yet, which I wish it was.  I think about smoking them on occasion still, but it normally helps when I smell one out any about and how gross it is.

Also, I think about how it can kill you and that stops the thoughts too.
