![Mitsubishi Kohitsu Shosha Pencil in 10B](/assets/img/blog-images/mitsubishi-kohitsu-shoshai-pencil-10b/pencil-front.jpg)

I've been on a wild pencil kick lately.  I've stayed mostly in the HB, B, and 2B range of graphite core hardness, but I was wondering what the really soft pencils were like.  I ordered a **[Tombow Mono Professional 6B](https://www.tombowusa.com/craft/pencils/mono-drawing-pencils-1579.html)**, and I thought I could get something darker.  Then I tried a **[Mitsubishi Hi-Uni 10B Pencil](https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Mitsubishi-Hi-Uni-Pencil-10B/pd/10947)**, and that was much darker than the Tombow Mono Professional 6B, I'd say near perfect.  The last thing I can think of to try is the **[Mitsubishi Kohitsu Shosha Pencil in 10B](https://cwpencils.com/products/kohitsu-shosha-pencil-10b)**, so I ordered it up to see if it was any darker.

Spoiler Alert:  Just stick with your Mitsubishi Hi-Uni 10B.

This pencil does come in an excessive but cute package for one singular pencil.  It's supposed to be a rare item, though I found it a few places online.

The pencil itself does look nice: the gold paint job, Hi-Uni like details like the rounded dipped ends, or the two gold foil rings (one more than a Hi-Uni!). But does the looks or performance justify the price increase ([$8 at CW Pencils](https://cwpencils.com/products/kohitsu-shosha-pencil-10b) or [$6.09 at The Thackery](https://www.thethackery.com/default/art-supplies/pencils/art-pencils/mitsubishi-uni/mitsubishi-fude-enpitsu-10b-rare-extra-large-lead-made-in-japan-choose-lot-of-1-3-6-or-12-pieces.html) over say a **Mitsubishi Hi-Uni 10B Pencil** that costs $2.50 to $2.75?

Not at all.  They perform exactly the same.  Same core widths, same length of pencil (the standard  ferrule and eraser-less 7 inches), and best I can tell, contain the exact same 10B core.

Not to say that this is a bad pencil.  It glides amazingly smooth across paper and leaves a very dark mark with ease. But you could get 2-3 Mitsubishi Hi-Uni 10B's for the same price, or for the price of 3 10B Kohitsu Shosha Pencils you can buy a [12 pack of Mitsubishi Hi-Uni 10B Pencils from JetPens](https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Mitsubishi-Hi-Uni-Pencil-10B-Box-of-12/pd/3517).

Should you buy this pencil?  If you are curious, I mean why the hell not?  I had a hard enough time not trying it.  But if you already have a Hi-Uni 10B, you pretty much already have this pencil at a half to a third of the cost, minimum.  I have to give the **Mitsubishi Kohitsu Shosha Pencil in 10B** the final score of **2 Zaffino Crazy Face Franks out of 5** based off of value alone.  Just stick to the Hi-Uni 10B.
