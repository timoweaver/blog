I've been on a wild pencil kick lately.  I've stayed mostly in the HB, B, And 2b range with my purchases, but I was wondering what the really soft pencils were like.  I ordered a Tombow Mono Professional 6B, and I thought I could get something darker.  Then I tried a Mitsubishi Hi-Uni 10B, and that was much darker.  The last thing I can think of to try is the **[Mitsubishi Kohitsu Shosha Pencil 10B](https://cwpencils.com/products/kohitsu-shosha-pencil-10b){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}**, so I ordered it up and saw what it could do.

Spoiler:  Just stick with your Mitsubishi Hi-Uni 10B.
