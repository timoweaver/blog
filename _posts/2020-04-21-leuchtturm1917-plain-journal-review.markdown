It's time to try something different in the search for the perfect sketchbook. I want one that's less a finished art piece, and more a combination of doodles and sketches and just playing with the media. More like a true sketchbook, really. My thoughts were if the paper was thinner, and there was more of it for the price, I'd get a little more out of it and be more willing to put whatever on the page. I've had a plain [Plain Classic Moleskine Journal](https://us.moleskine.com/classic-notebook-black/p0460) before a few times, and I kind of got this effect, so I thought I would try out the **[LEUCHTTURM1917 A5 Plain Journal](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/notebook-medium-a5-hardcover-251-numbered-pages-5-3-4-x-8-1-4-in.html)**.

There is a [LEUCHTTURM1917 Pen Loop](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/pen-loop-elastic-pen-holder-size-40-x-40-mm-15-mm-elastic-loop.html) attached, this is sold separately (more on that at the bottom of the review).

It's got 249 pages, which is **145 more pages** than the sketchbook I have been using recently: the [Moleskine Art Collection Sketchbook, Large](https://us.moleskine.com/sketchbook-black/p0437). Assuming you can get each sketchbook for around $22 (that seems about my average at shops) you're getting an extra sketchbook and a half of room in the LEUCHTTURM1917, right? Well, kinda.

The LEUCHTTURM1917 journal is pretty nice. It has the things you want in a hardcover sketchbook / journal: a layflat construction, elastic band to keep it shut, back pocket, **two whole ribbon bands** so you can keep your spot in two places, and the normal personal information slot on the front page so you can be contacted if you lose your book.

![LEUCHTTURM1917 Plain Journal Table of Contents page TOC](/assets/img/blog-images/leuchtturm1917-review/toc.jpg){: .half-width}

One of the extras I've never seen before in this journal is the table of contents. It's three pages long. I don't really intend to use it, but it's there. You could also use it as tester pages for new pens and paints.

![LEUCHTTURM1917 Plain Journal page numbers](/assets/img/blog-images/leuchtturm1917-review/page-num.JPG){: .half-width}

This thing also has page numbers on each page in the journal. Again, that's pretty neat, and could help with remembering where things are in the book (as well as the Table of Contents I suppose!). In regards to size, the LEUCHTTURM1917 is nearly the same height (8.25") as the Moleskine Art Collection Sketchbook, but it's nearly .5" inches wider than the Moleskine at 5.8" or so. The extra width is really nice, and feels more natural.

Now for the paper: it's great. It's got a nice fine tooth, enough to catch pencil without being too much, and certain materials will glide across the page. It's honestly great. But you run into an issue with the pages being just too thin if you want to use ink, let alone ink on both sides of the sheet.

![LEUCHTTURM1917 Plain Journal see through thin paper](/assets/img/blog-images/leuchtturm1917-review/thin-paper.jpg)

It's crazy see through. It's 80 gsm paper, it kinda reminds me of the paper they print the bible on. This is thinner than standard printer papers and [Rhodia Webnotebooks](https://rhodiapads.com/collections_boutique_webnotebook.php), which are around 90 gsm, or the Moleskine Art Collection sketchbook I mentioned above which is 165 gsm. Below you can see the drawing that is behind the page above:

![LEUCHTTURM1917 Plain Journal see through thin paper drawing](/assets/img/blog-images/leuchtturm1917-review/first-spread.jpg)
And that behavior continues through the whole book if you want to use ink:

![LEUCHTTURM1917 Plain Journal see through thin paper drawing](/assets/img/blog-images/leuchtturm1917-review/ghosting.jpg)

This is the single largest issue I have with the book. You can also have issues with ink bleeding through the paper. This will depend on your ink you use, and how saturated the paper gets. As well, ghosting to the back side of the page is going to be an issue:

![LEUCHTTURM1917 Plain Journal ink bleeding through paper](/assets/img/blog-images/leuchtturm1917-review/bleed-through.jpg){: .half-width}

And I could maybe get used to that, you just use one side of the page. But the amount of show through with ink on any page pretty much makes this a pencil only sketchbook if you never want to see the works on the other side of the page. I've done this for a bit, and in some ways it is kind of what I wanted: I can't even really finish a drawing in this book, if I want a fully inked illustration-y thing I kind of have to take this drawing out of the sketchbook. It even is nearly what I wanted out of this sketchbook experience in the first place.

But it's just a little too see through for my liking. It honestly becomes distracting, and even if I only use one of the sheet sides, that reduces this book to 124 pages, so I might as well just use the 104 page Moleskine Sketchbook at that point and use whatever pen and ink or media I want, whenever I want (within reason, I'm going to do a review of the Large soon to to complement my [A4 XL Moleskine Review](/review/2018/05/30/moleskine-art-plus-sketchbook-a4-review.html) I did a while back).

I'll continue using this book. This is a perfectly fine "getting shit done", rough and tumble sketchbook, but if the paper was just a little thicker it'd be easier to recommend.  This is getting close to that idea I had earlier about a book where it's easier to just "sketch", and I feel like I'm loosening up because of it. I just wish I was able to enjoy those sketches later without a 35% opacity drawing coming through from the other side. I'm gonna give the **LEUCHTTURM1917 A5 Plain Journal** 4 out of 5 Zaffino Crazy Face Franks.

**P.S.** The pen loops from LEUCHTTURM1917 are pretty handy and last through the use of the journal (I've used one to hold an Apple Pencil on my iPad case for 4 years and it hasn't budged). If you are looking for a solution for carrying just one pen or pencil on you, this is honestly a great choice.
