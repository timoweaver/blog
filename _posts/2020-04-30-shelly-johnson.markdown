![shelly johnson from twin peaks sketch Mädchen Amick](/assets/img/shelly-johnson.jpg){: .half-width}

This sketch was based off a photo of [Mädchen Amick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A4dchen_Amick) in [Twin Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks).  I've never actually finished Twin Peaks, and I wanna see the third season and that made for TV Movie.  

This was done in my [LEUCHTTURM1917 Plain Journal](/review/2020/04/21/leuchtturm1917-plain-journal-review.html) mainly with my [Pentel Pigment Ink xfp5m](/review/2018/07/03/pentel-pigment-ink-brush-pen-review-xfp5f-and-xfp5m.html) brush pen, but I added some Prismacolor Col-Erase color since I barely used any white out.  If I mess up and have to use white out you can't really color it anymore.
